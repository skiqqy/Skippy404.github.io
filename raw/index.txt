SBLOCK. About this website
This website serves as my little footprint on the
amazing creation that is the internet.
\\\\
Currently this website is running inside a docker container (found <a
href=https://github.com/skiqqy/skiqqy-docker>here</a>) on my raspberry pi. Most
of the services (git, blog, etc) are running inside of a docker container,
which is on the pi, however, the more heavy services (pleroma etc) run on an
entire different machine inside my local network, and gets accessed through a
<a href=https://www.nginx.com/>reverse proxy</a> on my pi.
\\\\
An important statement to make is, everything that is hosted on the skiqqy.xyz
domain, is hosted on my own machines locally.
\\\\
Another cool inclusion of my website, is the <a href=https://dev.skiqqy.xyz
target=blank_>dev server</a>, which reflects changes from upstream as they are
pushed.
\\\\
If you are interested in more more in depth explanation of the setup, you can
read this <a href=https://blog.skiqqy.xyz/new-vs-old/ target=blank_>post</a>,
as well as <a href=https://blog.skiqqy.xyz/nginxd/ target=blank_>this one</a>.

SBLOCK. What I consider bloat
* Any program that is not "minimal", in the sense
  that it does not conform to the unix philosophy
  of doing one thing, and doing that one thing well.
\\\\
* If the program is not free as in <a
  href=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html target=blank_>free</a>, then
  I assume the program is bloated and may be malware.

* Politics.

* Google.
