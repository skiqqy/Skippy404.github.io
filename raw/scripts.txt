WIP.
SBLOCK. #!/usr/bin/env sh
This area of my website is dedicated to logging my helper scripts, as well as
explaining thier use cases.

\\\\

Most of my scripts are kept inside my a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/bin/tree/bin/,
which I usually clone inside $HOME, which is included in my $PATH. With that
said, each title will link to said script.

\\\\

Other scripts fall outside of my bin include
\\ - Project Specific run scripts (I wont detail each script, but will describe
my general layout).
\\ - Scripts that have thier own dedicated repos, these will be listed here.

\\\\

Lastly I am only going to list the non-trivial scripts, and not my simple
a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/bin/tree/master/item/calc/wrapper/ scripts, as
these are not exciting.
