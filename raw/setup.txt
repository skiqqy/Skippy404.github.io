SBLOCK. Operating System & Desktop Environment
* Currently I am running <a href=https://getfedora.org>Fedora GNU/Linux</a>
\\\\
* As for desktop environment, A only use dwm, it fits my workflow perfectly,
  and I have spent the last few years perfecting it, I dont need a mouse, all I
  need is a keyboard, and I am comfortable.

SBLOCK. Workflow
* My workflow is simple: <a href=https://dwm.suckless.org/>dwm</a> + <a
  href=https://st.suckless.org/>terminal</a> + <a
  href=https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki>tmux</a> + <a
  href=https://www.vim.org/>vim</a>, once I have these, I am in my happy place,
  and produce really nice code.
\\\\
* Typically when starting a new project I use
  a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/skelly/skelly/ to init the boiler plate stuff
  (i.e. directory structures, git, Makefiles, README's etc). Once that is
  complete then I create (or attach to) a tmux session using
  a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/bin/tree/master/item/ws/ws/, and then begin
  coding away. If programming in C I use
  a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/bin/tree/master/item/tagd/tagd/ to keep my ctags
  files up to date.
  \\
  For version control I use a/https://git-scm.com/git/, and hosting my
  repositories remotely I use a/https://sourcehut.org/SourceHut/.
\\\\
* I have recently switched to <a href=https://dwm.suckless.org/>dwm</a> by <a
  href=https://suckless.org/>suckless</a>, the main reason for the switch from
  my previous wm (<a href=https://i3wm.org>i3wm</a>) is that I highly prefer
  the approach of forking and patching software to your desired format than
  editing a config that must be loaded at run time, that is I prefer having has
  much known at compile time as possible. Also, elitist.
\\\\
* I have written a script that sets up my workspace, and installs
  dependencies, this script can be downloaded <a
  href=https://skiqqy.xyz/install.sh>here</a>.
\\\\
* You can also get my configs on thier own:
    \\- a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/.dotfiles/.dotfiles/
    \\- a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/.tmux/.tmux/
    \\- a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/dwm/dwm/
    \\- a/https://git.sr.ht/~skiqqy/st/st/
