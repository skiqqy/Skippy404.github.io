SBLOCK Operating System & Desktop Environment.
* Currently I am running <a href=https://getfedora.org>Fedora GNU/Linux</a>
\\\\
* As for desktop environment, A only use dwm, it fits my workflow perfectly,
  and I have spent the last few years perfecting it, I dont need a mouse, all I
  need is a keyboard, and I am comfortable.

SBLOCK Workflow.
* My workflow is simple: <a href=https://dwm.suckless.org/>dwm</a> + <a
  href=https://st.suckless.org/>terminal</a> + <a
  href=https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki>tmux</a> + <a
  href=https://www.vim.org/>vim</a>, once I have these, I am in my happy place,
  and produce really nice code.
\\\\
* I have recently switched to <a href=https://dwm.suckless.org/>dwm</a> by <a
  href=https://suckless.org/>suckless</a>, the main reason for the switch was
  that my previous wm (<a href=https://i3wm.org>i3wm</a>) was very limiting,
  with dwm I can edit the source code directly, and so customize it to exactly
  what I want. Also, elitist.
\\\\
* I have written a script that sets up my workspace, and install's
  dependencies, this script can be downloaded <a
  href=https://skiqqy.xyz/install.sh>here</a>.
\\\\
* You can also get my configs on thier own:
    \\- ^/skiqqy/.dotfiles
    \\- ^/skiqqy/.tmux
    \\- ^/skiqqy/dwm
    \\- ^/skiqqy/st
